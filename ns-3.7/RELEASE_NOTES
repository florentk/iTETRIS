     destination address should be accepted as one of the host's own 
     addresses.  

  i) UniformDiscPositionAllocator added; distributes uniformly the nodes 
     within a disc of given radius. 

  j) ChannelNumber attribute added to YansWifiPhy. Now it is possible to 
     setup wifi channel using WifiPhyHelper::Set() method.

What is ns-3 ?
--------------

ns-3 is a new discrete-event network simulator designed for supporting network
research and education. ns-3 features a solid, well documented C++ core and 
models for TCP/IP (IPv4), several link types including WiFi, and mobility 
models.

ns-3 is an open source project released under the GNU GPLv2 license which 
allows anyone to use ns-3 without having to pay any license fee or royalties. 
ns-3 is actively seeking new contributors to extend the range of supported 
models and/or to maintain existing models.

Where to get more information about ns-3
----------------------------------------

All the ns-3 documentation, is accessible from the ns-3 website: 
http://www.nsnam.org

Including, tutorials:
http://www.nsnam.org/tutorials.html

Supported platforms
-------------------

ns-3 is regularly tested on the following platforms:
  - linux x86 gcc 4.2, 4.1, and, 3.4.6.
  - linux x86_64 gcc 4.1.3, 4.2.1, 3.4.6
  - MacOS X ppc and x86
  - cygwin gcc 3.4.4 (debug only)

Known issues
------------

ns-3 is known to fail on the following platforms:
  - gcc 3.3 and earlier
  - optimized builds on gcc 3.4.4 and 3.4.5
  - optimized builds on linux x86 gcc 4.0.x

The IPv4 API defined in src/node/ipv4.h is expected to undergo major changes 
in preparation of the merge of the IPv6 API and implementation.

Future releases
---------------

Our next release, which is expected to happen in 2 to 4 months from now, will

scripting, IPv6, emulation, a statistics framework and synchronous posix 
sockets.

Warning: among API changes in this release, Application::Start and 
Application::Stop now interprets the time argument as a relative
instead of absolute simulation time, to align with how Simulator::Schedule
behaves.  Any code that calls these APIs in the middle of the simulation 
will need to be adapted.

called Simulator::Stop (time), and takes a relative time, instead of 
absolute.
