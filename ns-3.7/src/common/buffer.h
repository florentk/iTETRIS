/**
 * \ingroup packet
 *
 * \brief automatically resized byte buffer
 *
 * This represents a buffer of bytes. Its size is
 * automatically adjusted to hold any data prepended
 * or appended by the user. Its implementation is optimized
 * to ensure that the number of buffer resizes is minimized,
 * by creating new Buffers of the maximum size ever used.
 * The correct maximum size is learned at runtime during use by 
 * recording the maximum size of each packet.
 *
 * \internal
 * The implementation of the Buffer class uses a COW (Copy On Write)
 * technique to ensure that the underlying data buffer which holds
 * the data bytes is shared among a lot of Buffer instances despite
 * data being added or removed from them.
 *
 * When multiple Buffer instances hold a reference to the same 
 * underlying BufferData object, they must be able to detect when
 * the operation they want to perform should trigger a copy of the
 * BufferData. If the BufferData::m_count field is one, it means that
 * there exist only one instance of Buffer which references the 
 * BufferData instance so, it is safe to modify it. It is also
 * safe to modify the content of a BufferData if the modification
 * falls outside of the "dirty area" defined by the BufferData.
 * In every other case, the BufferData must be copied before
 * being modified.
 *
 * To understand the way the Buffer::Add and Buffer::Remove methods
 * work, you first need to understand the "virtual offsets" used to
 * keep track of the content of buffers. Each Buffer instance
 * contains real data bytes in its BufferData instance but it also
 * contains "virtual zero data" which typically is used to represent
 * application-level payload. No memory is allocated to store the
 * zero bytes of application-level payload unless the user fragments
 * a Buffer: this application-level payload is kept track of with
 * a pair of integers which describe where in the buffer content
 * the "virtual zero area" starts and ends.
 *
 * ***: unused bytes
 * xxx: bytes "added" at the front of the zero area
 * ...: bytes "added" at the back of the zero area
 * 000: virtual zero bytes
 *
 * Real byte buffer:      |********xxxxxxxxxxxx.........*****|
 *                        |--------^ m_start
 *                        |-------------------^ m_zeroAreaStart
 *                        |-----------------------------^ m_end - (m_zeroAreaEnd - m_zeroAreaStart)
 * virtual byte buffer:           |xxxxxxxxxxxx0000000000000.........|
 *                        |--------^ m_start
 *                        |--------------------^ m_zeroAreaStart
 *                        |---------------------------------^ m_zeroAreaEnd
 *                        |------------------------------------------^ m_end
 *
 * A simple state invariant is that m_start <= m_zeroStart <= m_zeroEnd <= m_end
