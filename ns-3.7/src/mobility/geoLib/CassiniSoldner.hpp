  /**
   * \brief Cassini-Soldner Projection.
   *
   * Cassini-Soldner projection centered at an arbitrary position, \e lat0, \e
   * lon0, on the ellipsoid.  This projection is a transverse cylindrical
   * equidistant projection.  The projection from (\e lat, \e lon) to easting
   * and northing (\e x, \e y) is defined by geodesics as follows.  Go north
   * along a geodesic a distance \e y from the central point; then turn
   * clockwise 90<sup>o</sup> and go a distance \e x along a geodesic.
   * (Although the initial heading is north, this changes to south if the pole
   * is crossed.)  This procedure uniquely defines the reverse projection.  The
   * forward projection is constructed as follows.  Find the point (\e lat1, \e
   * lon1) on the meridian closest to (\e lat, \e lon).  Here we consider the
   * full meridian so that \e lon1 may be either \e lon0 or \e lon0 +
   * 180<sup>o</sup>.  \e x is the geodesic distance from (\e lat1, \e lon1) to
   * (\e lat, \e lon), appropriately signed according to which side of the
   * central meridian (\e lat, \e lon) lies.  \e y is the shortest distance
   * along the meridian from (\e lat0, \e lon0) to (\e lat1, \e lon1), again,
   * appropriately signed according to the initial heading.  [Note that, in the
   * case of prolate ellipsoids, the shortest meridional path from (\e lat0, \e
   * lon0) to (\e lat1, \e lon1) may not be the shortest path.]  This procedure
   * uniquely defines the forward projection except for a small class of points
   * for which there may be two equally short routes for either leg of the
   * path.
   *
   * Because of the properties of geodesics, the (\e x, \e y) grid is
   * orthogonal.  The scale in the easting direction is unity.  The scale, \e
   * k, in the northing direction is unity on the central meridian and
   * increases away from the central meridian.  The projection routines return
   * \e azi, the true bearing of the easting direction, and \e rk = 1/\e k, the
   * reciprocal of the scale in the northing direction.
   *
   * The conversions all take place using a GeographicLib::Geodesic object (by
   * default GeographicLib::Geodesic::WGS84).  For more information on
   * geodesics see \ref geodesic.  The determination of (\e lat1, \e lon1) in
   * the forward projection is by solving the inverse geodesic problem for (\e
   * lat, \e lon) and its twin obtained by reflection in the meridional plane.
   * The scale is found by determining where two neighboring geodesics
   * intersecting the central meridan at \e lat1 and \e lat1 + \e dlat1
   * intersect and taking the ratio of the reduced lengths for the two
   * geodesics between that point and, respectively, (\e lat1, \e lon1) and (\e
   * lat, \e lon).
