Installation instructions of GeographicLib

(1) On Linux and systems with GNU C++

(a) Compiles the code:

    make

(b) Make the documentation (requires Doxygen)

    make doc

(c) Install the headers and library

    make install

This installs into /usr/local.  To install elsewhere, use, e.g.,

    make PREFIX=/opt/local install

(d) Install the documentation

    make install-doc

You can provide a PREFIX here too.  You can access the documentation also at

    http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/html

(2) With autoconf

(a) Run

    ./configure

and then repeat the steps above.  If you want the library to be
installed in a different location, run

    ./configure --prefix=/opt/local

This procedue overwrites the Makefile used in (1).  To revert to
non-autoconf method, do

    echo include Makefile.mk > Makefile

(3) With Visual Studio 2005 (version 8) or 2008 (version 9).

(a) load the solution file windows/GeographicLib-vc9.sln (or -vc8) into
Visual Studio 2008 (or 2005) and build the solution.
