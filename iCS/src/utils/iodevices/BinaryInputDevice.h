 * @class BinaryInputDevice
 * @brief Encapsulates binary reading operations on a file
 *
 * This class opens a binary file stream for reading and offers read access
 *  functions on it.
 *
 * Please note that the byte order is undefined. Also the length of each
 *  type is not defined on a global scale and may differ across compilers or
 *  platforms.
 *
 * @todo Recheck whether this class could be replaced by a "normal InputDevice"
 * @todo Maybe some kind of a well-defined types should be used (so that they have a well-defined length)
 * @todo Maybe the byte-order should be defined
